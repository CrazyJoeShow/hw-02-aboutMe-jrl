# hw-02-aboutMe-jrl

- This is a from scratch project by myself so take it easy on me! It really is, as I'm sure you can tell when you get into the application. Which is an about me portfolio and contact info webpage.
- The first step to take open any browser.
- Second, open the provided link.
- You are brought to my "homepage" with a small bio about myself and some information for the HW. in this case a sort of electronic portfolio to add to a resume.
- The links in the navbar on each page should take you to where you would like to go within my application.
- Please do note I have messed up the CSS and will be revising once I find the issues, or revise when issue arise with the site.
- With the Rubric I would much rather show someone all the things I know and what I have to fix, than not "turn in HW" because it was the deadline...Turn it in show what i've got and keep learning from there.
