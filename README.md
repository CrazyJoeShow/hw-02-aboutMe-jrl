# hw-02-aboutMe-jrl

- This is a replication excersize of a portfolio page with 3 separate links. As I'm sure you can tell when you get into the application.

* With some help but started from scratch to build the pages.

- The first step to take open any browser.
- Second, open the provided link.
- You are brought to my "homepage" with a small bio about myself and some information for the HW. in this case a sort of electronic portfolio to add to a resume.
- The links in the navbar on each page should take you to where you would like to go within my application.
- Please do note I have messed up the CSS and will be revising once I find the issues, or revise when issue arise with the site.
- With the Rubric I would much rather show someone all the things I know and what I have to fix, than not "turn in HW" because it was the deadline...Turn it in show what i've got and keep learning from there.

* Getting close to crunch time, Definitely messed the CSS up, I will be updating once I get graded and will push the revisions.
* working the picture for the validation

- Starting off, a Repo was created in Github, created 3 HTML files and a CSS file
- these three file were individulized to 3 different but styled similar pages, the CSS being in the background.
- This project showed me how the predetermined customizations in bootstrap can really screw with what I have been trying to accomplish with the HTML and CSS as you can tell my styling is broken...So organization is key I have to start making more notes in the code to help me better reference what i'm looking for while styling.

I would like to thank leif one of our TA's who helped me immensely with just showing me to click my div to see where the closing partner is...makes bulding out columns a litter easier to see if you've screwed your order up.
Secondly Alex fleming who helped me grasp all the divs when building lines and pages, and Kai who puts notes in his code and I need to do that more!
